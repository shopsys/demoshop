# Shopsys Framework Demoshop

This repository is Demoshop project of Shopsys Framework - a **scalable ecommerce framework** for fast-growing ecommerce sites created and maintained by in-house developers or outsourcing agencies.

shopsys/demoshop repository contains demostration project to show how you can build your own project on top of Shopsys Framework.
It started in July of 2018 based on [shopsys/project-base](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base) and since then we added several new features that are not included in Shopsys Framework.
Its purpose is to demonstrate the possibilities of Shopsys Framework and also to test and validate all concepts of Shopsys Framework to ensure customizability and upgradability.

For more informations about Shopsys Framework, please see [shopsys/shopsys](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys) readme.

If you want to start your own project using Shopsys Framework you should use [shopsys/project-base](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base).

## Installation of New Shopsys Framework Project
We recommend to choose **installation via Docker** because it is the easiest and fastest way to start using Shopsys Framework.
Docker contains complete development environment necessary for running your application.
In the future we want to add new technologies to Shopsys Framework (e.g. ElasticSearch).
**Updating your development environment to use these technologies will be very easy with Docker**
because such an update will be done just by running `docker-compose build`.
And that is all!
